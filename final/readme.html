<!--
The purpose of this project was to show that we can take a raw form of data and transform it into 
something that makes sense to someone.
In this case we use visual aids. I chose the specific API because I found water usage interesting, it gave different dynamics.
It showed how the population increased, while  the water consumption per capita decreased.
